Password Vault App

A simple web app where users can generate strong passwords, save them securely, and manage their personal vault — all with client-side encryption so that passwords stay private.

Features

✅ Generate strong passwords (choose length, symbols, numbers, etc.)

✅ Save passwords with title, username, URL, and notes

✅ Edit or delete saved passwords easily

✅ Copy password to clipboard (auto-clears after 15 seconds)

✅ All passwords are encrypted on the client side
 
✅ Clean dark mode UI

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB

Crypto: AES encryption using crypto-js library (because it’s simple and secure for client-side encryption).
